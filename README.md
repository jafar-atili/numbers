# numbers

This is a simple C program that can translate a numbers in digits (between 0-99) to english.

Usage (Unix environment):

- ./numbers [input_numbers_digits_file] [output_numbers_translated_file]  
- ./numbers [input_numbers_digits_file] ::: the ouput numbers will be redirected to the standart output
- ./numbers  ::: the input will be taken from the standart input, the output will be printed to the standart ouput.

This program shows a simple usage of Command-Line-Argument in Unix environemnt, and how to use I/O system calls such open, reading and closing a file.
